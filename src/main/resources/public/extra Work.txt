Extra Work
- We used Get, Put, Delete and Post Endpoints --> all in the GruppeRestController
- We used Inheritance between Restaurant and Imbiss
- We used multiple M-N Relationships
- We have 7 Entities
- We used Native Queries with joins
- We used HTTP Basic authentication to protect the REST endpoints for the groups. for example delete request is only possile if its from an Admin user.
